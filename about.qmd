## Hello, I'm Gianfranco Basile

I'm a Statistics MSc student at ETH Zurich with a passion for applying advanced statistical methods and machine learning to solve real-world problems, particularly in climate science and healthcare.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and climate science. Currently, I'm working as a Visiting Graduate Researcher at IBM Research's AI for Climate Impact Lab, where I contribute to advanced climate modeling research using artificial intelligence.

Previously, I developed a machine learning framework for climate downscaling at ETH Zurich, integrating generative models to produce high-resolution forecasts from global climate models. My work on Corrective Diffusion Models improved MSE by 15% over existing methods.

I'm also interested in:

- Deep learning applications in healthcare
- Concept Bottleneck Models for Continual Learning
- High-dimensional statistics and computer vision
- Statistical modeling for environmental data

## Education

- **MSc in Statistics** (2023 - Present)  
  ETH Zurich, Switzerland  
  Focus: Deep Learning, High-Dimensional Statistics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning

- **BSc in Statistics** (2020 - 2023)  
  Universit√† degli Studi di Padova, Italy  
  Focus: Statistical Modelling, Multivariate Statistics, Time Series

## Professional Experience

As a Data Scientist at the Center of Dental Medicine Zurich, I deployed large language models to classify medical publications based on their adherence to good clinical practices and designed experiments to assist doctors in publication processes.

My research experience spans multiple projects:

- Development of machine learning frameworks for climate downscaling
- Implementation of Concept Bottleneck Models for Continual Learning
- Creation of predictive models for crop yield estimation using drone imagery
- Application of deep learning for heart disease prediction and pneumonia detection
- Development of novel approaches for evaluating functional diagnostic tests

## Technical Skills

- **Programming:** Python, R, SQL
- **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Operating Systems:** Windows, Linux

## Beyond Academia

When I'm not immersed in research and statistics, I'm passionate about environmental conservation and staying active through climbing, rowing, and CrossFit.
