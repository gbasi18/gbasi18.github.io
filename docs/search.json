    "text": "Research Interests\nMy research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and climate science. Currently, I’m working as a Visiting Graduate Researcher at IBM Research’s AI for Climate Impact Lab, where I contribute to advanced climate modeling research using artificial intelligence.\nPreviously, I developed a machine learning framework for climate downscaling at ETH Zurich, integrating generative models to produce high-resolution forecasts from global climate models. My work on Corrective Diffusion Models improved MSE by 15% over existing methods.\nI’m also interested in:\n\nDeep learning applications in healthcare\nConcept Bottleneck Models for Continual Learning\nHigh-dimensional statistics and computer vision\nStatistical modeling for environmental data"
